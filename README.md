### Aims
This program aims to have a main menu system to help the user what to do in a Library System that contains different set of choices such as update or insert a book that needs the user input to have a title,author,year and number if copies available.


### Usage
---
Start the program simply by `running it`

`Book Management System` was built to let the user have much efficient way to know what are the books he added in the dictionary.

```shell
Usage: Book Management System [Main Menu]

  Easily help user to save, search, update, delete a book and count the total 
  number of books in his dictionary.
  
Main Menu:
  --store_collection       Add a book with details in the dictionary.
  --remove_collection      Remove a book in the dictionary.
  --search_collection      Search the name of a book if its in the dictionary.
  --total_no_of_books      Shows how many books you add in the dictionary.
  --book_collection        Shows list of Books added in the dictionary with 
                           its details.
                           
```

### How it Works
1. In the `store_collection` it prompts the user to enter various `book details` such as `title`, `author`, `publishing year` and `number of copies`.
2. In the `remove_collection` the user was prompt to enter a `book title` that the user wants to `delete` after that it will be store in temp_dict and if the title is in there it will pop the book to remove it then it will show `Book Deleted Successfully` to show the user that it is already deleted.
3. In the `search_collection` this method will `search through the book collection` and if the title is in there it will look for its position and if it is there it will show `The Book is Found` to show the user it works.
4. In the `total_no_of_books` will show the user the `length` or the `size` of how many books are `stored` in the book collection.
5. In `book_collection` it will `show all` the books that are in the dictionary.
